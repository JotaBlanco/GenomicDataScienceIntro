1) How many records are in the file?
A record in a FASTA file is defined as a single-line header, followed by lines of sequence data.
The header line is distinguished from the sequence data by a greater-than (">") symbol in the first column.
The word following the ">" symbol is the identifier of the sequence, and the rest of the line is an optional description of the entry.
There should be no space between the ">" and the first letter of the identifier.
